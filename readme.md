#Basic API example (DIGG/Reddit voting clone)

This is the repository for the conference demo/page that lives at phpworld16.thedanherman.com.This

This requires the WP API to work correctly, built on WP 4.7 Beta 3. It also requires the [https://github.com/georgestephanis/application-passwords](application passwords) plugin and setup.

If you want to allow questions or votes, you will need to change `questions_enabled` and `voting_enabled` options, respectively, however you choose to do so.

**Under absolutely no circumstances would I suggest running this in production.** This is an experimental project only, and in several different cases uses REALLY BAD ideas.
